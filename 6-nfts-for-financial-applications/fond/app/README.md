# Fraction

Fraction is a platform where users can invest in assets, with the help of fractional NFTs. We set the entry barrier for high value items very low and therefore allow a brought investor base to invest in an asset class, that wasnâ€™t accessible for them beforehand.

 We research items with a high growth value and propose them on our website. Users can connect with their Radix wallet and buy fractions of the asset. One asset is represented by one NFT, which in turn is composed of multiple other NFTs. Those NFTs will verify the ownership of investors. Once a funding goal is reached, investors receive an NFT, representing their share and we will buy and store the item. When the asset increases in value according to our goals, we sell it and all holders share the profit. There is no risk if the funding goal is not reached, as users will get their money back immediately.

## Frontend
The frontend of this application is a basic React App.

Initially install the dependencies with `npm i` and then run `npm start` to run the application.




### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
