# Fraction

Fraction is a platform where users can invest in assets, with the help of fractional NFTs. We set the entry barrier for high value items very low and therefore allow a brought investor base to invest in an asset class, that wasnâ€™t accessible for them beforehand.

 We research items with a high growth value and propose them on our website. Users can connect with their Radix wallet and buy fractions of the asset. One asset is represented by one NFT, which in turn is composed of multiple other NFTs. Those NFTs will verify the ownership of investors. Once a funding goal is reached, investors receive an NFT, representing their share and we will buy and store the item. When the asset increases in value according to our goals, we sell it and all holders share the profit. There is no risk if the funding goal is not reached, as users will get their money back immediately.
