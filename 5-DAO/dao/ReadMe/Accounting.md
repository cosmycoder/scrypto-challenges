## Accounting

The accounting system needs to provide mechanisms for storing, tracking, and distributing Assets.

### Expenses

- Provide mechanisms for storing assets to pay expenses: Asset Vaults
- Provide a means of triggering resupply of expense vault assets.
- Provide a mechanism for triggering payment of expenses signed by an authorized badge
- Provide a mechanism for adding new expenses

### Earnings

- Provide a mechanism for storing DAO earnings: Asset Vaults
- Provide a mechanism for distributing earnings

### OrgOwned Assets including DAO owned tokens

- DAO owned tokens collect earnings equal to every other member token in order to provide operational assets.
- Operators need mechanisms to adjust the amount of org owned tokens to produce operating capital, growth capital etc.
