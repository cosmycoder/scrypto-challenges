# Community Driven Development

> A new way to think about building a business!

This was an idea that I had years ago which is now far more feasible with the advances in blockchain technology, DAOs in particular, and the unique capabilities opened up with Radix and Scrypto.

The general idea is to open up real world projects to the community and deliver direct rewards to contributors with ownership in the project.

To explain a bit further every contribution will recieve shares of ownership wether financial investment, programming, marketing, customer support, etc. There is NO REASON why any form of contribution can't be utilized and compensated fairly and equitably.

### To have a successful business requires the complete picture. Every contribution has real and tangible value, they should be rewarded as such.

With the shares earned every contributor gets a voice to vote on the direction of the project. To accommodate those who prefer to have a more hands off status they can choose to vote or delegate their votes to elected delegate representatives.

### Key Elements

- Shares or stock certificates this could be tokens or nfts
- Members & Roles - A combination of tokens and badges
- Accounting systems - How will the money flow?
- Voting - How will the DAO make decisions?
- Elections - How will the DAO elect leaders and how will it deal with non performing members in key roles.

### DAO

> Governance Contracts - Define the purpose of the organization.

- How the ownership structure will look.
- How operational positions will be compensated.
