        <p>
          Community Driven Development is a new way to build a business. A
          different approach to incubators, crowd funding and hiring.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Dev Path DAO Community Driven Development Initiative is designed
          to open up entreprenuership for all. The goal is to provide a platform
          where even those with seemingly no resources can bring great ideas and
          collaborate with great people who can help make those ideas reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          The platform gives you the tools you need to take the next step, no
          matter how early on in the process you are.
