Getting Started

You can interact with a deployed version @ https://devpathdao.web.app/
There is a known issue with account switching due to no event from test wallet.

`cd client`
`npm i`
`npm start`

Design summaries can be found in /ReadMe directory. With CDD.md "Comunnity Driven Development" as the top level starting point and category details expanded in supporting docs ie members, accounting, voting etc.

Navigate to Dashboard page where you can currently input DAO name, initial token sale price, and number to total shares(member_tokens). Click Create Member DAO Tokens button to load the vault with initial token supply and recieve the founders_badge in the calling account address. This is the tiny beginning of a DAO platform.

The blueprints get reused and automagically applied to the callers wallet as super user(founders_badge) making a seemless flow easily setting up new organizations.

If you think about this process in comparison to all the hoops required to start a business merchant account alone the same approach can be reused in a very simple manner for many forms of new business account creation.

From here you can navigate to the Marketplace where you can then purchase member tokens from any account. In a complete model the marketplace would serve as a place to crowdfund new projects.

There will also be an expansion via CreateProposal to facilitate work contributions which are awarded member tokens as a way to earn your way in with "sweat equity". This enables workers to gain equity and founders to build start ups with lower capital requirements.
