# flashyfi-scrypto

This project contains the FlashyFi scrypto code. The main code is contained in the `Flashyfi` blueprint. The
`DemoTokenFaucet` is just used to generate some test tokens so the demo frontend feels less empty.

All the important parts of the Flashyfi blueprint are documented in its source code.
