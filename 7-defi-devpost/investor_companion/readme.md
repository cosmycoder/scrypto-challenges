# Investor Companion

This is a platform where users specify their investment preferences, and protocols which meet their preference will be shown to them, then the users will can invest the amount they want into the pool, or they allow the system to automatically invest their funds into protocols that meet their yield preferences. Users of this platform pay a platform fee of 0.5% of total invested amount.

So when a user want to invest *100,000 XRD* using this platform, after collecting the users investment preferences, *0.5%* of the total capital is paid for the plaform fee *( 500 XRD ).* So the total amount left to invest is *99,500 XRD*.
