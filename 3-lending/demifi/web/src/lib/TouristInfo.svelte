<h1><Icon data={imgInfo} fill="blue" stroke="blue" size="36px"/> Tourist Information</h1>

<p style:text-align="justify">
  If you do not have the PTE browser extension installed then you
  cannot really have the full on-ledger-like experience but you can
  still visit as a tourist. You will be able to browse information and
  pretend like you're going to make changes, you just won't be able to
  commit those changes to the "ledger."
</p>

<p style:text-align="justify">
  Click the "Be a Tourist" button if you're just sightseeing.

<p style:text-align="justify">
 If on the other hand you want to upgrade to full ledger-like
 citizenship then please refer to the official documentation on
 installing the PTE browser
 extension <a href="https://docs.radixdlt.com/main/scrypto/public-test-environment/pte-getting-started.html">here
 on the RadixDLT web site.</a> (Or better yet: search that information
 on the internet yourself, don't trust random links you find in
 strange places.)
</p>

<p style:text-align="justify">
  You will need to follow those instructions down to (but not
  including) the "Start a New Project" section. (Because you're not
  starting a new project but instead you're connecting to an existing
  one, mine.)
