### Backend quick testing

1. Build the package: `scrypto build`
2. Quick end to end testing: `cd test && ./end_to_end.sh`

## Logic Explaination

### Use of a Medium Token:
The medium token which used in the whole Real Estate Manager protocol will be a token of the user (authority) choose.
If this protocol ever be used at country governments level, the authorities would consider using their CBDC as medium token.

### Simple, Secure, Private KYC by SBTs:
The SBT is locked in the citizen's wallet forever after their wallet have been KYCed.
The SBT not contain any data other than the NFT id, authorities can use that id to keep track of their citizen's private information.
This ensure the security of citizens information unless the citizens or authorities reveal the information.
The protocol is permissioned and require the KYC SBT to use. Anyone who isn't a part of the community cannot use this protocol.
*Real estate NFTs*, *modify right NFT* or *Trade order NFT* cannot be used by any account doesn't have the SBT.

### Real estate NFTs
Real estate deeds of the community will be managed by 2 type of NFT to prove the *owner rights* of citizens who have the NFT on their wallet: 
- Land Right's NFT: The NFT contain land information, included land's location, land's size and the building NFT id on that land (if the land contain a building).
- Building Right's NFT: The NFT contain building information, included building's size, building's floor.
1 land NFT can only contain 1 building NFT, this is for easier management, as well as trading on the market. If citizens want to build another building on their land, they will have to divide the land first.
Organizations can group their real estate NFTs however they want, this also help them to easily show which buildings, lands belong to the organizations.

### Real Estate Modify Right NFTs
There are 2 types of real estate *modify right* NFT on the protocol:
- Land modify right NFT: used on the ***Real Estate Service*** core blueprint, to authorize citizen's land modification.
- Construction right NFT: used on the ***Real Estate Construction Institute*** blueprint, to authorize citizen's building construction or demolition.

### Land Modify or Building Construct Authorization
Any authorized (KYCed) citizen can request a land modification or building construction (or demolition).
To review citizen requests on land modification or construction, authorities can make use of an **Oracle protocol** to feed in their map data and show the modification, construction is **feasible** or not.
- For land divide request: the oracle data must show the divide line is not overlapped with any existed real estate or construction.
- For land merge request: the oracle data must show that the two provided land is next to each other.
- For building construction or demolition request: the oracle data (or manually feeded data) must show that the construction (or demolition) will not cause harm to society (harm to the environment or any other damage).
After authorization, authorities will return the modify right's badge or just reject and delete the request.

### Real Estate Market Place
Working mostly the same as a NFT market place, making use of an *order book* which keep track of NFT's order.
The real estate market place is permissioned, only authorized citizens of the community can use the market. Likewise, their real estate NFTs can only be traded through these authorized markets (to prevent trading on "black market" or any 3rd party market).
After made a sell order, the maker received a *order NFT* to keep track of their order. Later they can use this NFT to cancel the order and take back their real estate NFTs or to take their payment after the order has been filled.

## Security, Utility

### What bad things won't happend on Real Estate Manager?

**Privacy Concern**: Citizen personal data is stored by the authority, there will be no privacy concern unless citizen or the authority reveal the information.

**Identity Concern**: The protocol is permissioned, only allow authorized account which has a clear identity.

### What bad things might happend on Real Estate Manager?

**Real Estate NFTs transfer to an Unauthorized Account**: Unfortunately, current Scrypto version don't have access rule to restrict which account can have a specific resource, so citizens can still deposit their real estate NFTs to unauthorized accounts through the protocol (specifically only through the ***buy method*** of the ***Real Estate Market Place*** protocol).

Although such a bad thing might happend on the protocol, it wouldn't be a critical problem. Authorities or any organization use the citizen's account to verify the real estate NFTs can also do the extra work of verify their KYC SBT. Moreover, the *mis-transfered* real estate NFTs cannot be withdrawn ever again from the unauthorized account unless they are ***recalled*** by authorities or the unauthorized person request a KYC himself.

**Lost of Property Deeds**: The property deeds is keeping tracked and managed by a permissioned protocol on Radix Ledger (instead of real papers). The deeds will never be lost unless the Radix Ledger stop functioning.

**Stealed, Hacked Property Deeds**: The property deeds cannot be stealed or hacked unless the Radix Ledger has security break (a >66% staked amount attack).

### What can't this Real Estate Manager do yet?

**Real estate lending**, **Renting** and **Mortgage**: Will included in future versions.
