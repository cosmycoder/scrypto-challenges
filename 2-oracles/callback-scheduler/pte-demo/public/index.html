    <h1>Callback Scheduler</h1>

    <h2>1. Fetch User Account Address</h2>
    <pre>Please note that you will be using a single account for this demo when in actuality there would be at least
two parties involved. However, for the sake of simplicity, you will take on both the role of the operator of the
CallbackScheduler as well as the role of one of its users.</pre>
    <p><button id="fetchAccountAddress">Click me</button> to get the account address of the PTE Browser Extension user.</p>
    <pre>Account address: <span id="accountAddress"></span></pre>

    <h2>2. Publish Package</h2>
    <p><button id="publishPackage">Publish</button></p>
    <pre>Package address: <span id="packageAddress"></span></pre>

    <h2>3. Instantiate a Callback Scheduler</h2>
    <pre>Instantiate a new CallbackScheduler component - the component that is actually demoed here.
A CallbackScheduler component is typically instantiated by a single operator and may then serve many individual users.</pre>
    <p><button id="instantiateSchedulerComponent">Instantiate CallbackScheduler</button></p>
    <pre>CallbackScheduler component address: <span id="schedulerComponentAddress"></span></pre>

    <h2>4. Instantiate a DummyComponent</h2>
    <pre>For this demonstration a DummyComponent is used that holds some tokens in a vault.
It has a burn_tokens method that may be used to burn a specified amount of the component's tokens.
You will schedule a call to this method in the next step.</pre>
    <p><button id="instantiateDummyComponent">Instantiate DummyComponent</button></p>
    <pre>DummyComponent address: <span id="dummyComponentAddress"></span></pre>
    <pre>DummyComponent's token balance: <span id="tokenBalance1"></span></pre>

    <h2>5. Schedule a callback</h2>
    <pre>Here, a callback to the DummyComponent's burn_tokens method is scheduled
by sending the following CallbackRequest struct to the CallbackScheduler component:

    Struct(
            Enum("AtDateTime", "2022-10-01T12:30:55+00", 120u8), // [1] The trigger
            ComponentAddress("${dummyComponentAddress}"), // [2] The target component of the callback
            "burn_tokens", // [3] The target method of the callback
            Vec&lt;Vec>(Bytes("a1100000000000a0dec5adc9353600000000000000")), // [4] The argument to the burn_tokens method
            None // [5] Don't use a different component for authorizing the callback
    )

1:   The callback should be executed at 2022-10-01T12:30:55+00 with a tolerance of 120 seconds.
     This is just an arbitrary example. You will execute the callback much earlier than specified here.
     This only works, though, because it would need a timer oracle to validate the correct execution
     time and that is not yet built into the present implementation.
     It would also be possible to set the execution time to a specific epoch. In this case, the
     CallbackScheduler component would validate that the call occurs in just that epoch and not in another.
     However, this is difficult to demonstrate here because one cannot influence the epoch of the demo environment.
2/3: The target of the callback will be the burn_tokens method of the DummyComponent
4:   This specifies that 1000 tokens should be burnt. What you see is just the encoded form of [Decimal("1000")]
5:   It is possible to have another component handle the callback authorization. This makes it possible to
     schedule callbacks for components, which code one cannot change. But, by passing None here, the
     DummyComponent that is the target of the callback will handle callback authorization by itself.

After calling the schedule_callback method one ends up with a CallbackHandle NFR on the transaction worktop.
If you take a look at how the transaction manifest is built you will see that this NFR is transferred to the
DummyComponent immediately. Without the CallbackHandle the DummyComponent would not be able to authorize the callback.</pre>
    <p><button id="scheduleCallback">Schedule Callback</button></p>
    <pre>Callback ID: <span id="callbackId"></span></pre>

    <h2>6. Check the token balance</h2>
    <pre>Check that the token balance is still 1000000 tokens and nothing has been  burnt yet.</pre>
    <p><button id="checkTokenBalance2">Get Balance</button></p>
    <pre>DummyComponent's token balance: <span id="tokenBalance2"></span></pre>

    <h2>7. Retrieve the CallbackAdminHandle</h2>
    <pre>In this step you will retrieve the CallbackAdminHandle NFR that is needed to execute the callback.</pre>
    <p><button id="getNewCallbackAdminHandles">Retrieve CallbackAdminHandle</button></p>
    <pre id="callbackAdminHandleRetrieved"></pre>

    <h2>7. Execute the callback</h2>
    <pre>Finally you will execute the callback. As stated above, the trigger condition is most likely
not met yet. However it still works as the trigger condition is not yet enforced in this implementation.</pre>
    <p><button id="executeCallback">Execute Callback</button></p>
    <pre id="callbackExecuted"></pre>

    <h2>8. Check the token balance</h2>
    <pre>Check the DummyComponent's token balance one last time. Observe that it has reduced by 1000 tokens.</pre>
    <p><button id="checkTokenBalance3">Get Balance</button></p>
    <pre>DummyComponent's token balance: <span id="tokenBalance3"></span></pre>
