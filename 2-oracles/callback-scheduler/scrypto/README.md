# CallbackScheduler

This package contains the main `CallbackScheduler` blueprint as well as a `TestComponent` for an automated test and
a `DummyComponent` for demonstrations via the Babylon PTE.

If you would like to run the automated test, simply execute the `test.sh` script in this directory. You can compare the
instructions in the script with the log output to understand what exactly happens during the test.

See [this README](../pte-demo/README.md) if you would like to run the PTE demo.
