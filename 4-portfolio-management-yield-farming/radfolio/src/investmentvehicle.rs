//! This blueprint demonstrates the interface you need to provide when
//! implementing an investment vehicle of your own. These methods are
//! used by Radfolio when managing its investments.
//!
//! The code in this file is provided for documentation purposes
//! only. It performs no useful function and can be removed from the
//! project with no ill effect.
//!
//! Note that [read_max_investable] is not used by Radfolio
//! directly but should still be implemented for the benefit of
//! front-end software which will want to display such information
//! to the user.
//!
//! Radfolio uses the [read_investment_value] method extensively when
//! rebalancing its investments and a great deal of care should go
//! into its design. A few rules of thumb:
//!
//! - It should take known losses into account as early as possible.

//! - It should take profits into account only when they have been
//! realized.

//! - If no better information is available, it can assume that funds
//! that have been deposited into an investment opportunity still
//! retain their original value.
//!
//! You will need to also write an `instantiate_` type function
//! for your component. This function should take as parameter the
//! `iv_control_badge` that Radfolio uses to control its
//! investment vehicles. The following methods always get called
//! with that badge in auth zone and you should implement them to
//! only be callable that way (i.e. with
//! `rule!(require(iv_control_badge))`).
//!
//! - [add_funds]
//! - [reduce_funds]
//! - [withdraw_profits]
//!
//! [add_funds]: blueprint::InvestmentVehicle::add_funds
//! [reduce_funds]: blueprint::InvestmentVehicle::reduce_funds
//! [withdraw_profits]: blueprint::InvestmentVehicle::withdraw_profits
//! [read_investment_value]: blueprint::InvestmentVehicle::read_investment_value
//! [read_max_investable]: blueprint::InvestmentVehicle::read_max_investable
