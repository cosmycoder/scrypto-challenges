# Components methods

| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| count | None | None | Writes in console the number of DUCKM test tokens in the component | 
| get_for_free | None | `nbr`: Decimal | Return as many duckm test tokens as requested for free
| get_with_radix | None | `nbr`: Decimal, payment: Bucket  | Return as many duckm test tokens as requested for 1 xrd per token. taken from the given bucket

## Blueprint: `OrderBook`
| Methods | Authorisation required | Arguments | Description
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |

| get_member_badge_address | None | None | Returns the resource address of the member badge
| become_member | None | `name`: String  | Returns your user badge allowing you to interact with the order book
| look_orderbook | None | `input`: Address, `output`: Address | Returns the order book for the pair: (`input`,`output`)  |

When we talk about peer, it is simply two exchangeable Resource Addresses. For example when using the pair (`input`, `output`). *If someone places an order with this one, it means that they want to sell the `input` resource and get in exchange the `output` ressource.*
| Methods | Authorisation required | Arguments | Description
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| init_pair_orderbook | Admin badge | `input`: Address, `ouput`: Address | Initialize the pair (`input`, `output`) |
| reset_pair_orderbook | Admin badge | `input`: Address, `ouput`: Address | Destroy all orders present for the pair (`input`, `output`)
| withdraw | Admin badge | `tokenAddress`: Address, `amount`: Decimal | Withdraw `amount` token from the `tokenAddress` Component Vault
| add_order_orderbook | Member badge | `input`: Address, `output`: Address, `amount`: Decimal, `price`: Decimal, `payment`: Bucket, `member_address`: Address | Place an order like this: `member_address` sell `amount` tokens of `input` for `price`*`amount` tokens of `output`.  |
| accept_an_order | Member badge | `input`: Address, `output`: Address, `amount`: Decimal, `price`: Decimal, `payment`: Bucket | Accept an order from this pair : (`input`,`output`) if anyone wants to sell `amount` tokens of `input` for `amount`*`price` tokens of `output`. The `payment` bucket need to be filled with enough tokens `output`, you need at least: `amount`\*`price` tokens of `output`  |
|update_register_orderbook | Member badge | `input`: Address, `ouput`: Address, `amoun`t: Decimal, `price`: Decimal, `member_address`: Address | Allows you to add a given order in the book of this pair |
|update_unsubscribe_orderbook | Member badge | `input`: Address, `ouput`: Address, `amount`: Decimal, `price`: Decimal, `member_address`: Address | Allows you to remove a given order in the book of this pair |

# How are orders stored ?

# Scrypto v0.3
Install the Scrypto Toolchain [docs.radixdlt.com](https://docs.radixdlt.com/main/scrypto/getting-started/install-scrypto.html) v0.3 to run. Or updating Scrypto to the latest version [docs.radixdlt.com](https://docs.radixdlt.com/main/scrypto/getting-started/updating-scrypto.html).
 
# Usage of the transaction manifest

Transaction manifest is the Radix-way of building transactions. Transaction manifests are human-readable and are translated into binary transactions by a compiler.

To show composability and allow easier testing we use this improvement

```sh
