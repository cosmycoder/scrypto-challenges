Our participation in the challenge is part of a decentralized Order book. Thanks to this set of blueprints you can exchange on peers defined by an administrator.
By adding an order to a pair anyone can observe the existing orders, find the best and thus fill an order. Thanks to this system, you can buy and sell tokens with Scrypto in a secure way !

# Features
- Place sales orders
- Buy a certain resource by buying it back from a seller.
- See placed orders.
- Found the most interesting order (best price).
- Accept a secure exchange.
- A badge system for DEX administrators and members.

| src/*.rs | Blueprint name | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| lib |  | Handle imports |
| duckm_test_tokens | TestTokens | Test Tokens blueprint |
| order_book | OrderBook | OrderBook blueprint |


# Components functions
## Blueprint: `TestTokens`
| Function | Argument | Returns
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| init | nameOfTheTestToken: String | Component: Component

## Blueprint: `OrderBook`
| Function | Argument | Returns
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| init | | (AdminBadge: Bucket, Component: Component)


# Components methods
## Blueprint: `TestTokens`
| Methods | Authorisation required | Arguments | Description
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| count | None | None | Writes in console the number of DUCKM test tokens in the component | 
| get_for_free | None | `nbr`: Decimal | Return as many duckm test tokens as requested for free
| get_with_radix | None | `nbr`: Decimal, payment: Bucket  | Return as many duckm test tokens as requested for 1 xrd per token. taken from the given bucket

## Blueprint: `OrderBook`
| Methods | Authorisation required | Arguments | Description
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| get_admin_badge_address | None | None | Returns the resource address of the admin badge |
| get_member_badge_address | None | None | Returns the resource address of the member badge
| become_member | None | `name`: String  | Returns your user badge allowing you to interact with the order book
| look_orderbook | None | `input`: Address, `output`: Address | Returns the order book for the pair: (`input`,`output`)  |
| get_best_price_orderbook | None | `input`: Address, `output`: Address | Returns the best order for the pair: (`input`,`output`)  |

When we talk about peer, it is simply two exchangeable Resource Addresses. For example when using the pair (`input`, `output`). *If someone places an order with this one, it means that they want to sell the `input` resource and get in exchange the `output` ressource.*
| Methods | Authorisation required | Arguments | Description
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| init_pair_orderbook | Admin badge | `input`: Address, `ouput`: Address | Initialize the pair (`input`, `output`) |
| reset_pair_orderbook | Admin badge | `input`: Address, `ouput`: Address | Destroy all orders present for the pair (`input`, `output`)
| withdraw | Admin badge | `tokenAddress`: Address, `amount`: Decimal | Withdraw `amount` token from the `tokenAddress` Component Vault
| add_order_orderbook | Member badge | `input`: Address, `output`: Address, `amount`: Decimal, `output_ratio`: Decimal, `payment`: Bucket, `user_address`: Address | Place an order like this: `user_address` sell `amount` tokens of `input` for `output_ratio`*`amount` tokens of `output`.  |
| accept_an_order | Member badge | `input`: Address, `output`: Address, `amount`: Decimal, `output_ratio`: Decimal, `payment`: Bucket | Accept an order from this pair : (`input`,`output`) if anyone wants to sell `amount` tokens of `input` for `amount`*`output_ratio` tokens of `output`. The `payment` bucket need to be filled with enough tokens `output`, you need at least: `amount`\*`output_ratio` tokens of `output`  |
|update_register_orderbook | Member badge | `input`: Address, `ouput`: Address, `amoun`t: Decimal, `output_ratio`: Decimal, `member_address`: Address | Allows you to add a given order in the book of this pair |
|update_unsubscribe_orderbook | Member badge | `input`: Address, `ouput`: Address, `amount`: Decimal, `output_ratio`: Decimal | Allows you to remove a given order in the book of a specific pair |

# How are orders stored ?

![alt text](assets/stored_orders.png)

Each order is stored in an vector which is the value of a pair, this pair is a tuple of the two addresses. The vector contains tuples, each of its tuples is an order. We find in the first position a table containing [number of tokens to sell, ratio of tokens in exchange on the th address in the pair], the second value of the tuple is the address to which the response to this order will be sent. In this case the chips in 2nd position in the pair

__For example :__
If we look at the key (Add1, Add2) in the orderbook variable :
We will find as value a vector with : [[`8`, `1.5`], `rdx1qsaaa...aaa`],[[`10`, `2`], `rdx1qszzz...zzz`]

You need to understand :
> `rdx1qsaaa...aaa` want to sell `8` Add1 tokens with a ratio of `1.5` Add2 tokens, so for 8 Add1 he want in exchange (8x1.5) Add2.
> `rdx1qszzz...zzz` want to sell `10` Add1 tokens with a ratio of `2` Add2 tokens, so for 10 Add1 he want in exchange (8x2) Add2.
# Scrypto v0.3
Install the Scrypto Toolchain [docs.radixdlt.com](https://docs.radixdlt.com/main/scrypto/getting-started/install-scrypto.html) v0.3 to run. Or updating Scrypto to the latest version [docs.radixdlt.com](https://docs.radixdlt.com/main/scrypto/getting-started/updating-scrypto.html).
 
# Usage of the transaction manifest

Transaction manifest is the Radix-way of building transactions. Transaction manifests are human-readable and are translated into binary transactions by a compiler.

To show composability and allow easier testing we use this improvement

```sh
---Soon---
```
